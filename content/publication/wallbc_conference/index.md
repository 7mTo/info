# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Nonlinear (entropy) stability analysis is used to derive entropy‚Äìstable no‚Äìslip wall boundary conditions at the continuous and semi‚Äìdiscrete levels for the Eulerian model proposed by Sv√§rd in 2018 (Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 2018). The spatial discretization is based on discontinuous Galerkin summation-by-parts operators of any order for unstructured grids. We provide a set of two‚Äìdimensional numerical results for laminar and turbulent flows simulated with both the Eulerian and classical Navier‚ÄìStokes models. These results are computed with a high-performance ‚Ñéùëù‚Äìentropy‚Äìstable solver, that also features explicit and implicit entropy‚Äìstable time integration schemes.
